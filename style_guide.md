# Basic Style / Code Quality guide
1. Follow PEP-8, generally
2. especially heed the warning that foolish consistency is the hobgoblin of little minds
3. autopep-8 helps here: `autopep8 --in-place --aggressive --aggressive <filename>`
4. Use pylint. Fix warnings & consistency issues; add explicit ignores when necessary

# This guide is expected to evolve over time
